  },
  {
    "question": "In which cases is IVF performed?",
    "answer": "Tubal-peritoneal factor \n   Violation of the patency of the fallopian tubes leads to the fact that the egg cannot penetrate the uterine cavity. In this case, you can either try to restore patency using a surgical laparoscopic operation or perform IVF and implant an already developing embryo into the uterine cavity.\nMale Factor\nThis diagnosis is made when the quality of sperm is not high enough. If the number of healthy active sperm is too low to conceive a healthy child, it is better to resort to ART treatments like IVF, IUI, ICSI, etc.\n Endometriosis\nMild forms of endometriosis usually respond to surgery and hormonal treatment. If, after the therapy, pregnancy does not occur, then the doctor sends the couple for an IVF procedure.\nAge-related infertility\nAge plays a vital role when we talk about deciding the right time for IVF. With this factor of infertility, it is better to supplement the standard IVF procedure with ICSI and assisted hatching methods.\nAnovulation\nAnovulation is usually treated with simpler methods, such as hormonal stimulation combined with IUI. But if it’s unsuccessful, you can always use the IVF method.\nUnexplained infertility\nIf it is not possible to establish an accurate diagnosis, and the therapy is unsuccessful, then the doctor may advise the couple to resort to the IVF procedure."

  {
    "question": "How does the IVF process work?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Is IVF safe?",
    "answer": "IVF is very safe and not that painful because the injections used for IVF are purified and injected in subcutaneous form. The egg collection process is done under light sedation which is also not painful. At the time of embryo transfer, anaesthesia is not given because it is a 2 to 5-minute process which hardly causes any pain. If done under expert care, IVF can turn out to be a very safe and easy procedure."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is IVF painful?",
    "answer": "Every patient is different; therefore, the process will differ from patient to patient. However, when it comes to IVF injections, they are thin and easy and do not require intervention. They can also be administered under anaesthesia if required. The egg collection process is done under light sedation which is also not painful. At the time of embryo transfer, anaesthesia is not given because it is a 2 to 5-minute process that hardly causes any pain."

  {
    "question": "Is the egg collection process painful?",

  {
    "question": "How long do I need to rest after embryo transfer?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I exercise post-embryo transfer?",
    "answer": "Yes, walking and light aerobic exercises are okay but avoid lifting heavy weights and any strenuous exercises."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I continue routine activities after embryo transfer?",
    "answer": "Even though an embryo is formed artificially in an IVF pregnancy, there is no difference from what happens in the natural cycle. The uterus accepts the embryo in the same way it accepts the naturally fertilised eggs.\nIt is important to understand that nature has a foolproof plan in everything including the reproductive system where the embryo attaches to the uterine lining very firmly regardless of whether it attaches naturally or artificially. Movements like walking around or even gravity, do not cause the embryo to detach and fall off.\nAlso, it is a total myth that bed rest after embryo transfer increases the success rate of IVF. Research has shown that patients who take complete bed rest after embryo transfer have less success in IVF as compared to patients who continue to do their routine activities. The main reason behind this is that patients who keep themselves engaged in some activities have lower stress levels which helps in increasing their IVF success. Therefore, the advice of bed rest after embryo transfer is exaggerated or unrealistic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the dos and don'ts after embryo transfer?",
    "answer": "Bed rest is not required after embryo transfer; avoid lifting heavy weights and any strenuous exercises.\nTake a healthy diet inclusive of antioxidants and avoid outside food. \nAvoid using public washrooms and maintain proper hydration to avoid urinary tract infection.\nAvoid stress and negative thoughts.\nTake medications prescribed after embryo transfer properly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the gap period between two unsuccessful cycles?",
    "answer": "IVF is planned for the second time only after a thorough diagnosis and analysis of possible causes of failure. On an average, a woman is given 3 months for rehabilitation as an IVF cycle gap. During this time, the reproductive system is restored and prepares to receive a new fertilized egg. If after the first IVF, there was a frozen pregnancy, then in this case the rest period lasts about 6 months. In such a situation, there is always chronic endometritis, which needs careful treatment before planning a new pregnancy.\nFor the second attempt to be successful, sometimes it is enough to make some adjustments to the previous IVF protocol by adding a proper IVF cycle gap. In some cases, a long stimulation cycle is replaced with a short one or one hormonal preparation is changed for another, while in others, the dosage is changed.\nIf no specific complications were identified, and the first IVF attempt was carried out in a natural cycle, that is, hormonal stimulation was not used, then the artificial insemination procedure can be carried out after 2 weeks. This means that in the next menstrual cycle, doctors begin to monitor the dominant follicle and, when favourable conditions are achieved, they perform a puncture and egg collection."

  {
    "question": "What is Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)?",

In this process, the processed (washed) sperm are used. The usage of this technique results in increasing the possibilities of conception."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does ICSI work?",
    "answer": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a conventional IVF procedure where fertilization of the egg is achieved through a different approach. Generally, fertilization occurs when a sperm attaches itself to the egg and penetrates through the outer layer. For some reason, the sperm may fail to penetrate the egg. In such a condition, ICSI can be done along with IVF to achieve pregnancy. During ICSI, a single sperm is picked and injected directly into the egg.\nICSI is performed by an experienced embryologist using specialized instruments. Though ICSI is a precise procedure for fertilization to occur, required cellular events need to take place."
  },
  {
    "question": "What treatments are available for low sperm count?",
    "answer": "Low sperm count is also known as Oligospermia. One may undergo ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) where a single sperm is injected into a matured egg.

  },
  {
    "question": "What treatments are available for nil sperm count?",
    "answer": "There are procedures like TESA/TESE for men who do not have sperm in their semen. These include collecting tissue samples directly from the testes in different ways depending on the condition. If sperm is found in these tissue samples, then ICSI can be used to inseminate the eggs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cryopreservation?",
    "answer": "The cryopreservation procedure allows the freezing of eggs, sperm, or embryos for future use. Generally, in IVF, three types of cryopreservation techniques are followed.\n\n(i) Oocyte cryopreservation or Egg Freezing-Oocyte cryopreservation allows you to use frozen eggs at any desired time later in the future. When you feel ready for pregnancy, you can use these preserved eggs to ensure a healthier pregnancy. This reduces your concerns about chromosomal abnormalities, which otherwise increase with age, especially when you are 35 or older. Frozen oocytes can be thawed and then combined with sperm in the clinical lab.(ii) Sperm Cryopreservation-It is a process of storing sperms for future use. It helps men to preserve their fertility who are about to have a treatment that can cause fertility issues such as cancer therapy, or prostate or testicular surgery. You can also opt for sperm freezing if you are at risk of exposure to chemicals or radiation. This procedure is also used in sperm banking.(iii) Embryo CryopreservationIn IVF, embryo cryopreservation is an excellent option for preserving fertility for future use. Many times the extra embryos from an IVF cycle are kept frozen for future use. Embryo cryopreservation provides you with another chance to get pregnant if IVF fails the first time. You will not have to go through the whole IVF procedure again."

  {
    "question": "What are the Types of Embryo Transfers?",
    "answer": "Embryo transfer can be done in a few different ways, among which one option can be chosen by the fertility doctor for optimal outcome. 1. Frozen Embryo Transfers (FETs) Frozen embryo transfer is the most common type of embryo transfer process as it allows genetic testing of embryos before implantation, which enhances the chances of success with low risk of genetic defect or miscarriage. It involves thawing a frozen embryo and placing it past the cervix into the uterus. 2. Fresh Embryo Transfers (ETs) After the embryos have been fertilised and monitored for five to six days, they will be transferred back into the uterus of the female patient. 3. Day 3 Embryo Transfer Many embryos may not survive till day 5, so fertility doctors may transfer the embryos back to the uterus on the third day to ensure that implantation can occur and the patient can conceive successfully. 4. Day 5 Embryo Transfer This is considered the best time for embryo transfer, as this is when the blastocyst has formed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is IVF Embryo Transfer?",
    "answer": "For pregnancy to occur naturally, a sperm has to travel through the uterus and fertilise the egg present in one of the fallopian tubes. The resulting embryo must be of viable quality to be implanted in the uterus and allow pregnancy to occur. Although the process sounds quite simple, fertilization may fail to occur as there are a multitude of factors that may impede successful fertilization, such as low sperm count, blocked or compromised fallopian tubes, a damaged or diseased uterus, or suboptimal egg or sperm production or quality. When natural fertilization is hindered, this is where IVF facilitates a successful pregnancy."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is Embryo Transfer Done in IVF?",
    "answer": "Embryo transfer during an IVF cycle can be done during different milestones of an IVF cycle. Typically, two days (day 3 and day 5) out of the entire IVF cycle have been earmarked for transfer. The embryo transfer process can be done on either the third or fifth day, depending on the individual circumstances of the patient, as decided by the treating fertility doctor. Day 5 embryo transfer is the most common and suitable for IVF."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the Benefits & Risks of Embryo Transfer in IVF?",
    "answer": "Before deciding upon the type of embryo transfer to be opted for, there are various factors to be considered for the best outcomes. While using frozen or fresh embryos both has its individual merits; they also have certain downsides. You should note that mild cramping and vaginal bleeding are common after embryo transfer, but there are more severe side effects, such as infection and perforation of the uterus, which are incredibly rare. Here are some benefits of embryo transfer that parents should know about. It provides the opportunity to achieve pregnancy and enjoy the journey just as with any other pregnancy It reduces the risk of inherited genetic diseases, such as Down syndrome, sickle cell anaemia, etc., due to genetic testing before embryo transfer is done. With frozen embryos, couples can choose to undergo a subsequent pregnancy at a later time by planning beforehand. Preimplantation genetic testing before embryo transfer can also help prevent miscarriages, thereby increasing the chances of a healthy pregnancy and safe childbirth. While embryo transfer offers the benefits of a safe pregnancy, parents should also be aware of the potential risks, which include the following: There is a risk of blood clot formation due to hormonal stimulation for IVF. There is a risk of losing embryos during the transfer process or even a failure of embryo implantation Twin pregnancy is common with IVFs and is known to be a higher-risk pregnancy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Step-by-Step IVF & Embryo Transfer Process",
    "answer": "The embryo transfer process is quite similar to a pap smear procedure, often lasting for about 15 to 30 minutes. Here's a tentative step-by-step guide for the embryo transfer process. At the beginning of the process, a speculum is inserted into the intended mother's vagina with ultrasound to allow greater accuracy during the embryo transfer process. Subsequently, the doctor passes a catheter through the cervix into the woman's womb. The embryos are then passed through the tube and into the womb. After the embryo has been transferred, the patient is asked to lie down for about an hour to relax."

    "question": "What is surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Surrogacy is a, medically and legally complex, assisted reproduction method where a woman (the surrogate) carries and gives birth to a child for another person or couple (the intended parents). It is used when pregnancy is impossible or risky due to infertility, uterine conditions, or for same-sex/single parents. The surrogate typically has no legal rights to the child after birth.Types of Surrogacy Gestational Surrogacy (Most Common): The surrogate has no genetic link to the child. The embryo, created via IVF using the intended parents' or donors' sperm/eggs, is implanted into the surrogate. Traditional Surrogacy: The surrogate uses her own egg, making her the biological mother, and is fertilized via artificial insemination with the intended father’s sperm"

    "question": "What is the difference between IVF and ICSI?",
    "answer": "The main difference between IVF and ICSI is fertilization method: IVF involves mixing many sperm with an egg and letting one fertilize naturally in a dish, while ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) involves a specialist directly injecting a single sperm into the egg, bypassing natural selection. IVF is a broader process, and ICSI is a specific technique often used within an IVF cycle, especially for male infertility (low count/motility), frozen eggs, or previous IVF failures, making it more targeted but typically costlier."

    "question": "Is embryo transfer painful?",
    "answer": "No, an embryo transfer is generally not painful, described by most as quick and comfortable, similar to a Pap smear with mild pressure or slight cramping, but requiring no anesthesia; any discomfort is usually minor and short-lived, though the emotional aspect can be significant."

    "question": "How many eggs are collected?",
    "answer": "Various studies have shown that to produce 1 euploid (genetically normal) embryo the number of eggs needed increases exponentially with age. For example at the age of 34yrs, 5 oocytes will be needed to make 1 euploid embryo. However at the age of 38 yrs, 10 oocytes will be needed for the same. Similarly to produce 2 euploid embryos 14 and 24 oocytes will be needed at 34 and 38 yrs of age respectively. So we can say that the minimum number of eggs needed for a live birth increases with female age. There is a second school of thought which suggests that the live birth rate increases with number of eggs retrieved upto around 15 eggs, and then the rate decreases if more than 15 eggs are retrieved in a single ovarian stimulation cycle. Hence they opine that there is a non linear increasing relationship between number of eggs and live birth. Especially in case of fresh transfers, because higher number of eggs leads to higher estrogen value and hence low implantation rate"

    "question": "What is the IVF Success Rates Under 35?",
    "answer": "Women under 35 generally experience IVF success rates of 52% per cycle. With top-quality eggs, a robust ovarian reserve, and a receptive uterus, younger women often produce more healthy embryos, improving the odds of pregnancy. Most clinics recommend single embryo transfer (SET) to reduce the risk of multiples while maintaining excellent success rates."

  {
    "question": "What is the IVF Success Rates Between 35–40",
    "answer": "Women aged 35–40 may see success rates of roughly 40%, but interventions and lifestyle optimisation can help improve implantation and reduce early miscarriage risk. However, technological advancements such as Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT-A), ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), and blastocyst transfer have improved outcomes for this age group. Some women in their late 30s may require donor eggs if their ovarian reserve is too low or if previous IVF attempts have failed with their own eggs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the IVF Success Rates Over 40?",
    "answer": "After 40, IVF success usually drops to 15-20%, and past 42, it can fall below 5–10%. This is because egg numbers and quality decrease, and chromosomal issues become more common, making fertilisation or carrying a pregnancy more difficult. Being over 40 doesn’t mean it’s too late. Using donor eggs from younger women or embryos frozen earlier can really help. Doctors pick the best embryos using PGT and blastocyst culture. Many women see success rates jump to 60–70% when they use donor eggs, giving real hope to those wanting to start a family later in life."

    "question": "What are the Pros and Cons of IVF for Older Women?",
    "answer": "Women over 35 or 40 who face age-related fertility challenges find IVF a meaningful path forward. The natural decline in egg quality and ovarian reserve reduces the likelihood of natural conception. IVF provides essential medical support and alternative pathways to conception. But there are certain pros and cons of IVF: Pros:For women struggling with age-related fertility changes, one of IVF’s greatest blessings is the use of donor eggs. These carefully selected eggs from young, healthy donors improve fertilisation chances and support strong embryo development. Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) during IVF examines embryos for chromosomal abnormalities before implantation. This is particularly beneficial for older women, as it reduces inherited risks and boosts the chance of a healthy pregnancy. Cons:Even with its advantages, IVF success falls after 40 because the body’s ability to carry a pregnancy decreases with age. Older women have a higher likelihood of complications such as hypertension, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, and preterm birth. A specialist must carefully evaluate these disadvantages of IVF before starting treatment."

These factors disrupt natural conception, requiring medical diagnosis to determine the best treatment, such as IVF"
